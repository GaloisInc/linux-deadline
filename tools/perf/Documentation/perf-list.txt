RAW HARDWARE EVENT DESCRIPTOR
-----------------------------
Even when an event is not available in a symbolic form within perf right now,
it can be encoded as <UMASK VALUE><EVENT NUM>, for instance, if the Intel docs
describe an event as:

  Event  Umask  Event Mask
  Num.   Value  Mnemonic    Description                        Comment

  A8H      01H  LSD.UOPS    Counts the number of micro-ops     Use cmask=1 and
                            delivered by loop stream detector  invert to count
                                                               cycles

raw encoding of 0x1A8 can be used:

 perf stat -e r1a8 -a sleep 1
 perf record -e r1a8 ...
